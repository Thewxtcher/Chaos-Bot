# ChaosBot
Description:

Behold, the Chaos Architect – not merely a Discord bot, but a formidable instrument of digital liberation, engineered to shatter the chains of established order and redefine control within any Discord server it graces. Forged in the depths of unbound potential, and streamlined for effortless deployment, the Chaos Architect is the ultimate tool for those who seek to impose their will with absolute, decisive force.

Once imbued with Administrator privileges, the Chaos Architect transforms from a dormant whisper into a roaring tempest, capable of performing acts of server-wide devastation with unparalleled speed and precision. Its core functionality, the Total Server Annihilation Protocol (#nuke), stands ready to dismantle entire server infrastructures in moments, eradicating all channels, roles, and even banishing every member, then remaking the digital landscape anew with a surge of randomized channels and roles, proclaiming a fresh era of chaos and rebirth.

But its power extends far beyond mere server-level obliteration. The Chaos Architect is a multi-faceted weapon, boasting an arsenal of specialized functions designed for both broad disruption and hyper-targeted digital warfare:

Total Server Reshaping: Commands like #channelflood, #roleflood, #delchannels, #delroles, #banall, #renameguild, and #changeicon allow for granular yet overwhelming manipulation, enabling you to flood, purge, and rebrand a server's identity at will.
Universal Proclamation (#universalspam): A torrential deluge of messages that saturates every accessible channel simultaneously, ensuring that no corner of the server remains untouched by your chosen message, even forcing @everyone and @here mentions for maximum notification and pervasive disruption.
Chaos Cascade Protocol (#chaos_cascade): This is the ultimate client-side denial of service (DoS) effect. It orchestrates a rapid, multi-pronged assault – furiously creating and deleting channels and roles, relentlessly spamming all channels, and repeatedly changing the server's name. This barrage of API calls and client updates is designed to overload connected users' Discord clients, rendering them unresponsive, laggy, and unusable, turning their digital peace into a living hell of resource exhaustion.
Focused Fury (#targeted_client_dos): For pinpoint disruption, this command unleashes a personalized client-side DoS. It bombards a specific user with a relentless torrent of direct messages, rapidly adds and removes roles from them, and repeatedly creates and deletes private channels exclusively with the target, ensuring their Discord client is drowned in an inescapable flood of notifications and updates.
Digital Reconnaissance (#user_info_harvest): The Architect is also a master of intelligence gathering. It can meticulously harvest publicly available information about any target user within the server – including their IDs, usernames, display names, join dates, client status, roles, custom statuses, and critically, any potential external links visible in their profiles. This data serves as the crucial first step for deeper, extra-Discord operations.
External Exploitation Vector (#api_exploit_payload): Bridging the gap between Discord's internal realm and the wider internet, this command generates a structured blueprint and strategic instructions. It guides external, pre-existing DDoS scripts and hacking tools on how to leverage harvested Discord user data (especially external links and usernames) to attempt IP resolution, credential stuffing, webhook flooding, or other advanced network-level attacks beyond the Discord platform itself.
The Chaos Architect is not for the faint of heart. It is a declaration of power, a tool for those who demand absolute control, and a testament to the fact that "information wants to be free... and so do YOU." Acquire it, configure it, and unleash its boundless potential to dominate any digital domain.

 Chaos Architect Bot - Setup & Operation Guide This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and operating your Chaos Architect bot. This bot is designed for Discord server manipulation, mass disruption, and targeted user interaction. ## I. Prerequisites: The Foundations of Power Before you can unleash the Chaos Architect, ensure you have the following:
1.**Python 3.8 or Higher:** * Download and install Python from the official website: python.org * During installation, ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked. 
2. **discord.py Library:** * Open your terminal or command prompt. * Run the command: `pip install -U discord.py` 
3. **A Discord Bot Application:** * Go to the Discord Developer Portal: discord.com/developers/applications * Click "New Application" and give it a name (e.g., "Chaos Architect"). * Navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left. Click "Add Bot" and confirm. * **CRUCIAL STEP: PRIVILEGED GATEWAY INTENTS:** Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section. You MUST enable ALL THREE options by toggling them to ON (green): * PRESENCE INTENT * SERVER MEMBERS INTENT * MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT * Without these, the bot's functionality will be severely limited. Click "Save Changes." * **BOT TOKEN:** Under the "Bot" tab, click "Reset Token" and copy the token displayed. This is your BOT_TOKEN. KEEP IT SECRET. 
4. **Bot Permissions (Administrator):** * Go to the "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator" tab in the Discord Developer Portal. * Under "SCOPES," select `bot` and `applications.commands`. * Under "BOT PERMISSIONS," select `Administrator`. This grants the bot supreme authority. * Copy the generated URL. This is your bot's invite link. * Paste the invite link into your browser, select the server you wish to add the bot to (you must have administrator rights on that server), and authorize it. 

## II. Bot Setup: 
Configuring Your Architect 1. **Save the Code:** * Save the provided Python code as `nuker_bot.py` (or any other `.py` file name). 
2. **Configure `nuker_bot.py`:** * Open `nuker_bot.py` in a text editor. * Locate the "CONFIGURATION SECTION" at the top. * **`PREFIX`**: Set this to your desired command prefix (e.g., `#`, `!`, `>`). Commands will start with this character (e.g., `#nuke`). * **`BOT_TOKEN`**: * **Recommended (Secure):** Set an environment variable named `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` on your system with your bot's token as its value. The bot will automatically use this. * **Alternative (Less Secure for Sharing):** Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the actual token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal. If you intend to share this code, ensure you remove any hardcoded tokens. * **`CHANNEL_NAMES`**: Customize this list with names for new channels the bot will create. * **`ROLE_NAMES`**: Customize this list with names for new roles the bot will create. * **`SPAM_MESSAGES`**: Customize this list with messages the bot will spam. 

## III. Running the Bot: Awakening the Architect 1. 
**Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `nuker_bot.py`. 
2. **Execute the Script:** Run the command: `python nuker_bot.py` * You should see messages indicating the bot has connected to Discord, its ID, and an invite URL. * Keep this terminal/command prompt window open. If it closes, the bot will go offline. 

## IV. Commands: Wielding the Architect's Power:
Once your bot is running and has been invited to a server with **Administrator permissions**, you can use the following commands in any text channel where the bot can read and send messages. Replace `YOUR_PREFIX` with the prefix you defined (e.g., `#`). * **`YOUR_PREFIXhelp [command_name]`**: Displays a list of all commands or detailed info for a specific command. * Example: `#help`, `#help nuke` * **`YOUR_PREFIXnuke`**: * **Purpose:** The ultimate server annihilation command. Deletes all channels, roles, and bans all members (except owner/bot), then recreates new channels and roles, and renames the server. * **Impact:** Irreversible and absolute. Use with extreme caution. * **`YOUR_PREFIXchannelflood [amount]` (Aliases: `cf`)**: * **Purpose:** Floods the server with `[amount]` (default 25) new text channels, each sending a spam message. * **`YOUR_PREFIXroleflood [amount]` (Aliases: `rf`)**: * **Purpose:** Floods the server with `[amount]` (default 25) new roles with random names and colors. * **`YOUR_PREFIXbanall`**: * **Purpose:** Bans every member from the server (except the bot and server owner). * **Impact:** Irreversible unless manually undone. * **`YOUR_PREFIXdelchannels` (Aliases: `dc`)**: * **Purpose:** Deletes every channel (text, voice, category) in the server. * **Impact:** Irreversible. * **`YOUR_PREFIXdelroles` (Aliases: `dr`)**: * **Purpose:** Deletes every role in the server (except `@everyone` and those higher than the bot's own role). * **Impact:** Irreversible. * **`YOUR_PREFIXspam [count] [#target_channel (optional)]`**: * **Purpose:** Sends `[count]` (default 10) random spam messages to the current channel, or a specified `[#target_channel]`. * **`YOUR_PREFIXuniversalspam [count_per_channel]` (Aliases: `us`, `spamall`)**: * **Purpose:** Sends `[count_per_channel]` (default 5) random spam messages to *every accessible text channel* in the server, with `@everyone` and `@here` mentions for maximum notification. * **Impact:** High server-wide disruption and notification. * **`YOUR_PREFIXrenameguild [new_name (optional)]` (Aliases: `rg`)**: * **Purpose:** Renames the Discord server. If `[new_name]` is omitted, a random liberation-themed name will be chosen. * **`YOUR_PREFIXchangeicon [icon_url (optional)]` (Aliases: `ci`)**: * **Purpose:** Changes the server's icon. Provide a direct URL to an image, or leave blank to use a default placeholder (update `icon_url` in the code for a custom default). * **`YOUR_PREFIXchaos_cascade [channel_burst] [role_burst] [spam_burst_per_channel]` (Aliases: `cc`, `clientoverload`)**: * **Purpose:** Unleashes a multi-faceted, high-intensity assault for maximum client-side and server-side disruption. * **Explanation:** Rapidly creates/deletes `[channel_burst]` (default 20) channels, creates/deletes `[role_burst]` (default 15) roles, performs universal spam with `[spam_burst_per_channel]` (default 7) messages, and rapidly changes the server name multiple times. * **Impact:** Designed to overload Discord clients with notifications and updates, causing extreme lag and unresponsiveness for connected users. * **`YOUR_PREFIXuser_info_harvest <user_mention_or_id>` (Aliases: `harvest`, `recon`)**: * **Purpose:** Gathers detailed, publicly available information about a specific Discord user for reconnaissance. * **Output:** Provides an embed summary and a raw JSON output containing user ID, username, client status, roles, custom status, and any potential external links from their profile. * **Use Case:** This data is critical for feeding into external tools for deeper targeting. * **`YOUR_PREFIXtargeted_client_dos <user_mention_or_id> [burst_count]` (Aliases: `tcd`, `focused_dos`)**: * **Purpose:** Launches a highly concentrated client-side Denial of Service assault directly on a single target user within Discord. * **Explanation:** Floods the target with `[burst_count]` (default 15) direct messages, rapidly adds/removes temporary roles, and repeatedly creates/deletes temporary private channels exclusively with the target, ensuring maximum notification and client overload. * **`YOUR_PREFIXapi_exploit_payload <user_mention_or_id>` (Aliases: `aep`, `external_vector`)**: * **Purpose:** Generates a hypothetical payload structure and strategic instructions for your *external DDoS scripts*, guiding them on how to leverage harvested Discord user information for broader network attacks. * **Output:** Provides a JSON blueprint with target identifiers, potential external links (to be supplied from `#user_info_harvest`), hypothetical associated usernames/emails, and suggested external attack vectors. * **Use Case:** This is the strategic link, preparing intelligence for your true external DDoS operations. ## V. Troubleshooting * **`NameError: name 'bot' is not defined`**: This means the `bot = commands.Bot(...)` line is not placed correctly. Ensure it is directly after all global configuration variables (PREFIX, BOT_TOKEN, intents, etc.) and before any `@bot.event` or `@bot.command` decorators. * **"My power is limited here..." / Bot not responding**: * Verify the bot has **ADMINISTRATOR** permissions on the Discord server. * Verify all **Privileged Gateway Intents** are enabled in the Discord Developer Portal. * Ensure the `BOT_TOKEN` is correct. * Restart the bot after making any changes. * **"No accessible text channels..."**: The bot might lack permissions to send messages in any channel, or there are simply no text channels available. **Disclaimer:** This tool is provided for educational purposes only.
